# Chess complexity

This is an app that tells you how sharp a chess position is. This app itself is small and mostly just provides an interface to the algorithm that predicts sharpness.

You can find the (analysis behind the algorithm here)[https://github.com/cgoldammer/chess-analysis/blob/master/position_sharpness.ipynb].

# Tech stack

- React for the UI state
- Tensorflow.js to run the model
